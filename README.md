# Description
DE1 Dungeon is a 2D top-down action/survival game. The player controls a fearless knight
that uses his golden dagger to defend himself. Ghost will appear on the map and chase the
player around. In order to defend against the ghost, daggers can be thrown at enemy ghosts
and explosive barrels. When a dagger hits a barrel it will explode, damaging all entities within the explosion's radius. 
Once the playerâ€™s health bar is completely red then it is game over. The goal of
the game is to kill ghosts and survive as long as you can.
